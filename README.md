# GETTING STARTED

We use Ruby version 2.2.5, so you'll probably want that.

Then...

     bundle install

     npm install

     rails server

And visit [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000/) to run the sample app.

## Running tests

To run javascript/karma specs:

     npm test

To run ruby specs:

     bundle exec rspec spec/[directory]
